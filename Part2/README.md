# Logical qubit entaglement and error detection
This work is greatly inspired by the article [Entangling logical qubits with lattice surgery](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03079-6), preprint available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03071) by A.Erhard, H.P.Nautrup, M.Meth, L.Postler, R.Stricker, M.Ringbauer, P.Schindler, H.J.Briegel, R.Blatt, N.Friis and T.Monz.

In this notebook, I reproduce some results of the great work of the original authors to gain insight on the limitations and challenges linked to encoding logical information into qubits.

## Usage
The notebook can be read with its outputs as is.
It is recommanded to not "Run all" cells, as the azure jobs would be relaunched, and results overwritten and will take a long time to recompute. Otherwise, cells defining operation that are simulated locally can be modified and re-executed of course.
